        <h1>Primo</h1>

        <p>Primo is a sparkling water brand inspired by a small Mexican port called Acapulco. The concept is a beverage dedicated to those who, no matter where they are, always have their minds on the beach, on the sea. 

            For this branding, I drew inspiration from specific elements of my visits to the sea, such as the large striped beach towels represented in the lines on the can. Behind the word "primo," you can see an orange circle that alludes to the sunset sun. The word "primo" means "cousin" in English and is commonly used where I was born to refer to someone, even if they are not actually related.</p>
