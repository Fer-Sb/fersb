        <h1>Noizze</h1>

        <p>Since I was very young, I have always had a tiny obsession with typography. Creating my own has been a project I've always wanted to develop, and I finally managed to achieve my first proposal. Noizze is a display font created to accompany compositions and even to function as a design piece; needless to say, its purpose is not to be body copy.

            When deciding to create a typeface of this style, I knew it would be a challenge because each letter has a different personality. However, I had to find something to unite them, a common denominator, and in this case, it was the square. Each of these letters were created within a perfect square so that together they would have a visual resemblance.</p>
